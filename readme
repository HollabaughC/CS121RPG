== Welcome to Untitled CS Game! ==
This is a final project for Elizabethtown College's CS-341 Software Engineering Class. Our goal is to use Unity 6 to make a companion game 
for students going through our Introduction to Computer Science class. As it tends to be difficult for beginning programmers, we wanted
to find a way to introduce programming concepts in a fun and interesting way. 

This project will attempt to help teach Python fundamentals to new students, while also introducing aspects of college life that aren't 
taught in class, such as work-life balance. 

Some of the topics we will include are:
- How to use Python
- Type Conversion
- Lists
- Dictionaries/Tuples
- Turtle
- Basic Pandas

Our program is going to be an executable, and we plan on having a way for professors to update the question banks for future classes. 

Our contributors include:
